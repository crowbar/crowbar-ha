Welcome to a Barclamp for the Crowbar Framework project
=======================================================

The code and documentation is distributed under the [Apache 2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
Contributions back to the source are encouraged.

The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) is currently maintained by [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/) as
an [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) installation framework but is prepared to be a much broader function tool. It was
originally developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack).

A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar. Core barclamps operate the essential
functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

**This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required**

This is NOT usable at the moment! Don't even try unless you want to help with the development effort! (Help is of
course very welcome - contact the Crowbar mailing list.)

This barclamp will automatically deploy and configure Pacemaker clusters, with the end goal of making the OpenStack
infrastructure services and their dependencies highly available. It will be based to a large extent on the architecture
documented at:

  http://docs.openstack.org/high-availability-guide/content/
