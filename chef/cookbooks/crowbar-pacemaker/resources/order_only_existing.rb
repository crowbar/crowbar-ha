# The goal of this resource is to make it possible to define ordering
# constraints on a set of resources, while some of the resources exist in a
# deployment, but not necessarily in this pacemaker cluster: we do not want to
# include resources that do not exist in this cluster when creating the
# ordering constraint.
#
# Example (using the default provider we ship):
#
# crowbar_pacemaker_order_only_existing "o-mywebapp" do
#  score "Mandatory"
#  ordering ["database", "apache", "mywebapp"]
#  action :create
# end
#
# If at least two resources among ["database", "apache", "mywebapp"] exist in
# this HA cluster, then an ordering constraint will be created.  If there's one
# resource that is not in this HA cluster, then it will be skipped. For
# instance, if the database lives elsewhere, this resource will be equivalent
# to:
#
# pacemaker_order "o-mywebapp" do
#  score "Mandatory"
#  ordering "apache mywebapp"
#  action :create
# end
#
