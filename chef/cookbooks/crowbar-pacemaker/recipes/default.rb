# We let the founder go first, so it can generate the authkey and some other
# initial pacemaker configuration bits; we do it in the compile phase of the
# chef run because the non-founder nodes will look during the compile phase for
# the attribute, while the attribute is set during the convergence phase of the
# founder node.
# Note that resetting this sync mark should be avoided after the initial setup
# is done: since wait is done during compile phase and create is done during
# convergence phase, it can create a drift between the founder node and the
# non-founder nodes.

# nodes) -- see the corosync::authkey_generator recipe.
