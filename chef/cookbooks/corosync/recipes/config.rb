  # Given that the reloads might happen while some of the nodes still having
  # the old configuration, this approach is not valid for updating nodelist
  # or votequorum parameters, but should work for amending token timeouts.
  # Ideally we would synchronize between all nodes after the config files are
  # updated, and then just run the reload on a single node, but we can only
  # achieve that when the proposal is being applied, and we need something
  # which works with the convergence runs.
