      # This stubs Mixlib::ShellOut.new with a sequence of doubles
      # with a corresponding sequence of behaviours.  This allows us
      # to simulate the output of a series of shell commands being run
      # via Mixlib::ShellOut.  Each double either mimics a successful
      # command execution whose #stdout method returns the given
      # string, or a failed execution with the given exit code and
      # STDOUT/STDERR.
      #
      # results is an Array describing the sequence of behaviours;
      # each element is either a string mimicking STDOUT from
      # successful command execution, or a [stdout, stderr, exitcode]
      # status mimicking command execution failure.
      #
      # For example, "crm configure show" is executed by
      # #load_current_resource, and again later on for the :create
      # action, to see whether to create or modify.  So the first
      # double in the sequence would return an empty definition if we
      # wanted to test creation of a new CIB object, or an existing
      # definition if we wanted to test modification of an existing
      # one.  If the test needs subsequent doubles to return different
      # values then stdout_strings can have more than one element.
