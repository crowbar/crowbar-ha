Description
===========

This cookbook provides a bare bones framework for CMAN.  It has not
been tested: the code was originally in the `corosync` cookbook, which
was the wrong place for it (since not all consumers of Corosync use
CMAN), but rather than just deleting it, it was moved here in case
anyone wants to resurrect it.
